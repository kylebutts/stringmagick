R package authors write functions. And, guess what, these functions can fail for various reasons.
A most hated yet most useful endeavor of package authors is to write proper error handling.
Error handling is about giving the right information to the user to help him debug as fast as possible.
It can save them a ton of time and bring them peace of mind (yes, true!).

However, and trust me, writing good error handling is a pain.
After fishing out the precise cause of the problem (and there can be **many**),
you need to write a message which contains enough information 
for the user to understand and solve the problem.
In other terms, it involves writing for the human behind the computer and not writing for the machine (i.e. code).
Given how critical error handling is, any tool alleviating its burden is welcome, and 
that's precisely where this introduction is heading!

The stringmagick package (combined to dreamerr) offers tools to create text messages 
in a very efficient way.
In particular, we're interested in pluralization (i.e. putting text in singular/plural 
depending on context).

This document guides you through some of its pluralization features by means of practical 
examples. For starters, it is advised to have a look to the introductory smagick vignette.


```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```
