one difficulty with this function is that  it is not of the form fun(arg1, arg2), etc.
This means that there is no argument help popping when needed. There is even no argument list!
It makes it them rely on muscle memory. Although the author tried to find names that make 
sense and can be easily memorized,
knowing how to use the function right from the start can be challenging.
This is the price to pay to have highly efficient features.
So please have a look at what it can achieve to decide whether it's worth the investment.
Note that the basic features of string interpolation (a la glue) can be learned effortlessly. 
The (big) rest is only bonus!
