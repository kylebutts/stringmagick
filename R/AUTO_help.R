txt = c("", "# Interpolation and string operations: Principle ----|", 
"", "To interpolate a variable, say `x`, simply use `{x}`. For example `x = \"world\"; smagick(\"hello {x}\")` leads to \"hello world\".", 
"", "To any interpolation you can add operations. Taking the previous example, say we want to display \"hello W O R L D\". This means upper casing all letters of the interpolated variable and adding a space between each of them. Do you think we can do that? Of course yes: smagick(\"hello {upper, ''s, c ? x}\"). And that's it.", 
"", "Now let's explain what happened. Within the `{}` *box*, we first write a set of operations, here \"upper, ''s, c\", then add \"?\" and finally write the variable to interpolate, \"x\".  The operations (explained in more details below) are `upper`, upper-casing all letters, ''s: splitting with the empty string, 'c': concatenating with spaces the vector of string that was just split. The question mark means that the expression coming after it is to be evaluated (this is opposed to the exclamation mark presented next).", 
"", "The syntax is always the same: {operations ? expression}, where the operations section is a *comma separated* list of operations. These operations are of the form `'arg'op`, with `arg` the argument to the operator code `op`. These operations are performed sequantially from left to right.", 
"", "Some operations, like `upper`, accept options. You attach options to an operation with a dot followed by the option name. Formally: `op.option1.option2`, etc. Example: `x = \"hi there. what's up? fine.\" ; smagick(\"He said: {upper.sentence, Q ? x}\")`. Leads to: `He said: \"Hi there. What's up? Fine.\"`.", 
"", "Both operators and options are partially matched. So `smagick(\"He said: {up.s, Q ? x}\")` would also work.", 
"", "# Verbatim interpolation and nesting: Principle ----|", 
"", "Instead of interpolating a variable, say `x`, with `{x}`, you can use an exclamation mark to trigger varbatim evaluation. For example `smagick(\"hello {!x}\")` would lead to \"hello x\". It's a bit disappointing, right? What's the point of doing that? Wait until the next two paragraphs.", 
"", "Verbatim evaluation is a powerful way to apply operations to plain text. For example: `smagick(\"hello {upper, ''s, c ! world}\")` leads to \"hello W O R L D\".", 
"", "(A note in passing. The spaces surrounding the exclamation mark are non necessary, but when one space is present on both sides of the `!`, then the verbatim expression only begins after it. Ex: \"{upper! hi}\" leads to \" HI\" while \"{upper ! hi}\" leads to \"HI\" and \"{upper !  hi}\" leads to \" HI\".)", 
"", "The second advantage of verbatim evaluations is *nesting*. Anything in a verbatim expression is evaluated with the function `smagick`. This means that any *box* will be evaluated as previously described. Let's give an example. You want to write the expression of a polynomial of order n: a + bx + cx^2 + etc. You can do that with nesting. Assume we have `n = 2`.", 
"", "Then `smagick(\"poly({n}): {' + 'c ! {letters[1 + 0:n]}x^{0:n}}\")` leads to \"poly(2): ax^0 + bx^1 + cx^2\".", 
"", "How does it work? The verbatim expression (the one following the exclamation mark), here \"{letters[1 + 0:n]}x^{0:n}\", is evaluated with `smagick`. `smagick(\"{letters[1 + 0:n]}x^{0:n}\")` leads to the vector c(\"ax^0\", \"bx^1\", \"cx^2\").", 
"", "The operation `' + 'c` then concatenates (or collapses) that vector with ' + '. This value is then appended to the previous string.", 
"", "We could refine by adding a cleaning operation in which we replace \"x^0\" and \"^1\" by the empty string. Let's do it:", 
"", "`smagick(\"poly({n}): {' + 'c, 'x\\\\^0|\\\\^1'r ! {letters[1 + 0:n]}x^{0:n}}\")` leads to \"poly(2): a + bx + cx^2\", what we wanted.", 
"", "You can try to write a function to express the polynomial as before: although it is a simple task, my guess is that it will require more typing.", 
"", "# Operations: General syntax ----|", "", "As seen in the previous sections, within a *box* (i.e. `\"{}\"`), multiple operations can be performed. We can do so by stacking the operations codes and in a comma separated enumeration. Operations can have arguments, and operations can also have options. The general syntax, with argument and options, is:", 
"", "`{'arg1'op1.optionA.optionB, arg2 op2.optionC, `arg3`op3, 51op4 ? x}`", 
"", "The argument can appear in four forms: a) inside single or double quotes just before the operation name (`arg1` above), b) verbatim, separated with a space, just before the operation name (`arg2` above), c) inside bactick quotes the argument is evaluated from the environment (`arg3` above), or d) when the argument is an integer it can be juxtaposed to the opeation name (like in `op4` above).", 
"", "The options are always dot separated and attached to the operation name, they are specific to each operation.", 
"", "Both the operation name and the option names are partially matched.", 
"", "# Basic string operations ----|", "", "This section describes some of the most common string operations: extracting, replacing, collapsing, splitting, etc. These functions accept generic flags (\"ignore\", \"fixed\", \"word\") in their patterns (syntax: \"flags/pattern\"). Please see the dedicated section for more information on flags.", 
"", "+ s, S: splits the string according to a pattern. The two operations have different defaults: `' '` for `s` and ',[ \\t\\n}*' for `S` (i.e. comma separation). Ex.1: `smagick(\"S ! romeo, juliet\")` leads to the vector c(\"romeo\", \"juliet\"). Ex.2: `smagick(\"{'f/+'s, '-'c ! 5 + 2} = 3\")` leads to \"5 - 2 = 3\" (note the flag \"fixed\" in `s`'s pattern).", 
"  + c, C: to concatenate multiple strings into a single one. The two operations are identical, only their default change. c: default is ' ', C: default is ', | and '. The syntax of the argument is 's1' or 's1|s2'. s1 is the string used to concatenate (think `paste(x, collapse = s1)`). In arguments of the form `'s1|s2'`, `s2` will be used to concatenate the last two elements. Ex.1: `x = 1:4; smagick(\"Et {' et 'c ? x}!\")` leads to \"Et 1 et 2 et 3 et 4!\". Ex.2: `smagick(\"Choose: {', | or 'c ? 2:4}?\")` leads to \"Choose: 2, 3 or 4?\".", 
"  + x, X: extracts patterns from a string. Both have the same default: '[[:alnum:]]+'. `x` extracts the first match while `X` extracts **all** the matches. Ex.1: `x = c(\"6 feet under\", \"mahogany\") ; smagick(\"{'\\\\w{3}'x ? x}\")` leads to the vector c(\"fee\", \"mah\"). Ex2.: `x = c(\"6 feet under\", \"mahogany\") ; smagick(\"{'\\\\w{3}'X ? x}\")` leads to the vector c(\"fee\", \"und\", \"mah\", \"oga\").", 
"  + extract: extracts multiple patterns from a string, this is an alias to the operation `X` described above. Use the option \"first\" to extract only the first match for each string (behavior becomes like `x`). Ex: `x = c(\"margo: 32, 1m75\", \"luke doe: 27, 1m71\") ; smagick(\"{'^\\\\w+'extract ? x} is {'\\\\d+'extract.first ? x}\")` leads to c(\"margo is 32\", \"luke is 27\").", 
"  + r, R: replacement within a string. The two operations are identical and have no default. The syntax is `'old'` or `'old => new'` with `'old'` the pattern to find and `new` the replacement. If `new` is missing, it is considered the empty string. This operation also accepts the flag \"total\" which instruct to replace the fulll string in case the pattern is found. Ex.1: `smagick(\"{'e'r ! Where is the letter e?}\")` leads to \"Whr is th lttr ?\". Ex.2: `smagick(\"{'(?<!\\\\b)e => a'R ! Where is the letter e?}\")` leads to \"Whara is tha lattar e?\". Ex.3: `smagick(\"{'t/e => here'r ! Where is the letter e?}\")` leads to \"here\".", 
"  + get: restricts the string only to values respecting a pattern. This operation has no default. It uses the same syntax as [str_get()] so that you can include logical operations with ' & ' and ' | '. Example: `x = row.names(mtcars) ; smagick(\"Mercedes models: {'Merc & [[:alpha:]]$'get, '^.+ 'r, C ? x}\")` leads to \"Mercedes models: 240D, 280C, 450SE, 450SL and 450SLC\".", 
"  + is: detects if a pattern is present in a string, returns a logical vector. This operation has no default. Mostly useful as the final operation in a [str_op()] call. Example: `x = c(\"Mark\", \"Lucas\") ; smagick(\"Mark? {'i/mark'is, C ? x}\")` leads to \"Mark? TRUE and FALSE\".", 
"  + which: returns the index of string containing a specified pattern. With no default, can be applied to a logical vector directly. Mostly useful as the final operation in a [str_op()] call. Ex.1: `x = c(\"Mark\", \"Lucas\") ; smagick(\"Mark is number {'i/mark'which ? x}.\")` leads to \"Mark is number 1.\".", 
"", "# Operations changing the length or the order ----|", "", 
"+ first: keeps only the first `n` elements. Example: `smagick(\"First 3 numbers: {3 first, C ? mtcars$mpg}.\")` leads to \"First 3 numbers: 21, 21 and 22.8.\". Negative numbers as argument remove the first `n` values. You can add a second argument in the form `'n1|n2'first` in which case the first `n1` and last `n2` values are kept; `n1` and `n2` must be positive numbers.", 
"  + K, Ko, KO: keeps only the first `n` elements; has more options than `first`. The syntax is 'n'K, 'n|s'K, 'n||s'K. The values Ko and KO only accept the two first syntax (with `n` only). `n` provides the number of elements to keep. If `s` is provided and the number of elements are greater than `n`, then in 'n|s' the string `s` is added at the end, and if 'n||s' the string s replaces the nth element. The string `s` accepts specials values:", 
"  + `:n:` or `:N:` which gives the total number of items in digits or letters (N)", 
"  + `:rest:` or `:REST:` which gives the number of elements that have been truncated in digits or letters (REST) Ex: `smagick(\"'3|:rest: others'K ? 1:200\")` leads to the vector `c(\"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"197 others\")`.", 
"  + The operator 'n'Ko is like `'n||:rest: others'K` and 'n'KO is like `'n||:REST: others'K`.", 
"  + last: keeps only the last `n` elements. Example: `smagick(\"Last 3 numbers: {3 last, C ? mtcars$mpg}.\")` leads to \"Last 3 numbers: 19.7, 15 and 21.4.\". Negative numbers as argument remove the last `n` values.", 
"  + sort: sorts the vector in increasing order. Example: `x = c(\"sort\", \"me\") ; smagick(\"{sort, c ? x}\")` leads to \"me sort\". **Important note**: the sorting operation is applied before any character conversion. If previous operations were applied, it is likely that numeric data were transformed to character. Note the difference: `x = c(20, 100, 10); smagick(\"{sort, ' + 'c ? x}\")` leads to \"10 + 20 + 100\" while `smagick(\"{n, sort, ' + 'c ? x}\")` leads to \"10 + 100 + 20\" because the operation \"n\" first transformed the numeric vector into character.", 
"  + dsort: sorts the vector in decreasing order. Example: `smagick(\"5 = {dsort, ' + 'c ? 2:3}\")` leads to \"5 = 3 + 2\". Same note as for the operation \"sort\".", 
"  + rev: reverses the vector. Example: `smagick(\"{rev, ''c ? 1:3}\")` leads to \"321\".", 
"  + unik: makes the string vector unique. Example: `smagick(\"Iris species: {unik, C ? iris$Species}.\")` leads to \"Iris species: setosa, versicolor and virginica.\".", 
"  + each: repeats each element of the vector `n` times. Option \"c\" then collapses the full vector with the empty string as a separator. Ex.1: `smagick(\"{/x, y}{2 each ? 1:2}\")` leads to the vector `c(\"x1\", \"y1\", \"x2\", \"y2\")`. Ex.2: smagick(\"Large number: 1{5 each.c ! 0}\") leads to \"Large number: 100000\".", 
"  + times: repeats the vector sequence `n` times. Option \"c\" then collapses the full vector with the empty string as a separator. Example: `smagick(\"What{6 times.c ! ?}\")` leads to \"What??????\".", 
"  + rm: removes elements from the vector. Options: \"empty\", \"blank\", \"noalpha\", \"noalnum\", \"all\". The *optional* argument represents the pattern used to detect strings to be deleted. Ex.1: x = c(\"Luke\", \"Charles\"); smagick(\"{'i/lu'rm ? x}\") leads to \"charles\". By default it removes empty strings. Option \"blank\" removes strings containing only blank characters (spaces, tab, newline). Option \"noalpha\" removes strings not containing letters. Option \"noalnum\" removes strings not containing alpha numeric characters. Option \"all\" removes all strings (useful in conditions, see the dedicated section). If an argument is provided, only the options \"empty\" and \"blank\" are available. Ex.2: `x = c(\"I want to enter.\", \"Age?\", \"21\"); smagick(\"Nightclub conversation: {rm.noalpha, c ! - {x}}\")` leads to \"Nightclub conversation: - I want to enter. - Age?\"", 
"  + nuke: removes all elements, equivalent to `rm.all` but possibly more explicit (not sure). Useful in conditions, see the dedicated section. Example: `x = c(5, 7, 453, 647); smagick(\"Small numbers only: {if(.>20 ; nuke), C ? x}\")` leads to \"Small numbers only: 5 and 7\";", 
"  + insert: inserts a new element to the vector. Options: \"right\" and \"both\". Option \"right\" adds the new element to the right. Option \"both\" inserts the new element on the two sides of the vector. Example: `smagick(\"{'3'insert.right, ' + 'c ? 1:2}\")` leads to \"1 + 2 + 3\".", 
"", "# Formatting operations ----|", "", "+ lower: lower cases the full string.", 
"  + upper: upper cases the full string. Options: \"first\" and \"sentence\". Option \"first\" upper cases only the first character. Option \"sentence\" upper cases the first letter after punctuation. Ex: `x = \"hi. how are you? fine.\" ; smagick(\"{upper.sentence ? x}\")` leads to \"Hi. How are you? Fine.\".", 
"  + title: applies a title case to the string. Options: \"force\" and \"ignore\". Option \"force\" first puts everything to lowercase before applying the title case. Option \"ignore\" ignores a few small prepositions (\"a\", \"the\", \"of\", etc). Ex: `x = \"bryan is in the KITCHEN\" ; smagick(\"{title.force.ignore ? x}\")` leads to \"Bryan Is in the Kitchen\".", 
"  + ws: normalizes whitespaces (WS). It trims the whitespaces on the edges and transforms any succession of whitespaces into a single one. Can also be used to further clean the string with its options. Options: \"punct\", \"digit\", \"isolated\". Option \"punct\" cleans the punctuation. Option \"digit\" cleans digits. Option \"isolated\" cleans isolated letters. WS normalization always come after any of these options. **Important note:** punctuation (or digits) are replaced with WS and **not** the empty string. This means that `smagick(\"ws.punct ! Meg's car\")` will become \"Meg s car\".", 
"  + trimws: trims the white spaces on both ends of the strings.", 
"  + q, Q, bq: to add quotes to the strings. q: single quotes, Q: double quotes, bq: back quotes. `x = c(\"Mark\", \"Pam\"); smagick(\"Hello {q, C ? x}!\")` leads to \"Hello 'Mark' and 'Pam'!\".", 
"  + format, Format: applies the base R's function [base::format()] to the string. By default, the values are left aligned, *even numbers* (differently from [base::format()]'s behavior). The upper case command (`Format`) applies right alignment. Options: \"0\", \"zero\", \"right\", \"centre\", \"center\". Options \"0\" or \"zero\" fills the blanks with 0s: useful to format numbers. Option \"right\" right aligns, and \"centre\" or \"centre\" centers the strings. Ex: `x = c(1, 12345); smagick(\"left: {format.0, q, C ? x}, right: {Format, q, C ? x}\")` leads to \"left: '000001' and '12,345', right: '     1' and '12,345'\".", 
"  + %: applies [base::sprintf()] formatting. The syntax is 'arg'% with arg an sprintf formatting, or directly the sprint formatting, e.g. `% 5s`. Example: `smagick(\"pi = {%.3f ? pi}\")` leads to \"pi = 3.142\".", 
"  + stop: removes basic English stopwords (the snowball list is used). The stopwords are replaced with an empty space but the left and right WS are untouched. So WS normalization may be needed (see operation `ws`). `x = c(\"He is tall\", \"He isn't young\"); smagick(\"Is he {stop, ws, C ? x}?\")` leads to \"Is he tall and young?\".", 
"  + ascii: turns all letters into ASCII with transliteration. Non ASCII elements are transformed into question marks. Options: \"silent\", \"utf8\". By default, if some conversion fails a warning is prompted. Option \"silent\" disables the warning in case of failed conversion. The conversion is done with [base::iconv()], option \"utf8\" indicates that the source endocing is UTF-8, can be useful in some cases.", 
"  + n: formats integers by adding a comma to separate thousands. Options: \"letter\", \"upper\", \"0\", \"zero\". The option \"letter\" writes the number in letters (large numbers keep their numeric format). The option \"upper\" is like the option \"letter\" but uppercases the first letter. Options \"0\" or \"zero\" left pads numeric vectors with 0s. Ex.1: `x = 5; smagick(\"He's {N ? x} year old.\")` leads to \"He's five year old.\". Ex.2: `x = c(5, 12, 52123); smagick(\"She owes {n.0, '$'paste, C ? x}.\")` leads to \"She owes $5, $12 and $52,123.\".", 
"  + N: same as `n` but automatically adds the option \"letter\".", 
"  + nth: when applied to a number, these operators write them as a rank. Options: \"letter\", \"upper\", \"compact\". Ex.1: `n = c(3, 7); smagick(\"They finished {nth, enum ? n}!\")` leads to \"They finished 3rd and 7th!\". Option \"letter\" tries to write the numbers in letters, but note that it stops at 20. Option \"upper\" is the same as \"letter\" but uppercases the first letter. Option \"compact\" aggregates consecutive sequences in the form \"start_n_th to end_n_th\". Ex.2: smagick(\"They arrived {nth.compact ? 5:20}.\") leads to \"They arrived 5th to 20th.\". Nth: same as `nth`, but automatically adds the option \"letter\". Example: `n = c(3, 7); smagick(\"They finished {Nth, enum ? n}!\")` leads to \"They finished third and seventh!\".", 
"  + ntimes: write numbers in the form `n` times. Options: \"letter\", \"upper\". Option \"letter\" writes the number in letters (up to 100). Option \"upper\" does the same as \"letter\" and uppercases the first letter. Example: `smagick(\"They lost {C ! {ntimes ? c(1, 12)} against {/Real, Barcelona}}.\")` leads to \"They lost once against Real and 12 times against Barcelona.\".", 
"  + Ntimes: same as `ntimes` but automatically adds the option \"letter\". Example: `x = 5; smagick(\"This paper was rejected {Ntimes ? x}...\")` leads to \"This paper was rejected five times...\".", 
"  + cfirst, clast: to select the first/last characters of each element. Ex: smagick(\"{19 cfirst, 9 clast ! This is a very long sentence}\") leads to \"very long\". Negative numbers remove the first/last characters.", 
"  + k: to keep only the first n characters (like cfirst but with more options). The syntax is `nk`, `'n'k`, `'n|s'k` or `'n||s'k` with `n` a number and `s` a string. `n` provides the number of characters to keep. Optionnaly, only for strings whose length is greater than `n`, after truncation, the string `s` can be appended at the end. The difference between 'n|s' and 'n||s' is that in the second case the strings will always be of maximum size `n`, while in the first case they can be of length `n + nchar(s)`. Ex: `smagick(\"{4k ! long sentence}\")` leads to \"long\",  `smagick(\"{'4|..'k ! long sentence}\") ` leads to \"long..\", `smagick(\"{'4||..'k ! long sentence}\")` leads to \"lo..\".", 
"  + fill: fills the character strings up to a size. Options: \"right\", \"center\" and a free-form symbol. Option \"right\" right aligns and \"center\" centers the strings. You can pass a free-form symbol as option, it will be used for the filling. By default if no argument is provided, the maximum size of the character string is used. See help for [str_fill()] for more information. Ex.1: `smagick(\"Numbers: {'5'fill.0.right, C ? c(1, 55)}\")` leads to \"Numbers: 00001 and 00055\".", 
"  + paste: pastes some character to all elements of the string. This operation has no default. Options: \"both\", \"right\", \"front\", \"back\", \"delete\". By default, a string is pasted on the left. Option \"right\" pastes on the right and \"both\" pastes on both sides. Option \"front\" only pastes on the first element while option \"back\" only pastes on the last element. Option \"delete\" first replaces all elements with the empty string. Example: `smagick(\"6 = {'|'paste.both, ' + 'c ? -3:-1}\")` leads to \"6 = |-3| + |-2| + |-1|\".", 
"", "# Other operations ----|", "", "+ num: converts to numeric. Options: \"warn\", \"soft\", \"rm\", \"clean\". By default, the conversion is performed silently and elements that failed to convert are turned into NA. Option \"warns\" displays a warning if the conversion to numeric fails. Option \"soft\" does not convert if the conversion of at least one element fails. Option \"rm\" converts and removes the elements that could not be converted. Option \"clean\" turns failed conversions into the empty string, and hence lead to a character vector. Example: `x = c(5, \"six\"); smagick(\"Compare {num, C, q ? x} with {num.rm, C, q ? x}.\")` leads to \"Compare '5 and NA' with '5'.\", and `smagick(\"Compare {num.soft, C, q ? x} with {num.clean, C, q ? x}.\")` leads to \"Compare '5 and six' with '5 and '.\".", 
"  + enum: enumerates the elements. It creates a single string containing the comma separated list of elements. If there are more than 7 elements, only the first 6 are shown and the number of items left is written. For example `smagick(\"enum ? 1:5\")` leads to \"1, 2, 3, 4, and 5\". You can add the following options by appending the letter to enum after a dot:", 
"  + q, Q, or bq: to quote the elements", "  + or, nor: to finish with an 'or' (or 'nor') instead of an 'and'", 
"  + i, I, a, A, 1: to enumerate with this prefix, like in: i) one, and ii) two", 
"  + a number: to tell the number of items to display Ex.1: `x = c(\"Marv\", \"Nancy\"); smagick(\"The main characters are {enum ? x}.\")` leads to \"The main characters are Marv and Nancy.\". Ex.2: `x = c(\"orange\", \"milk\", \"rice\"); smagick(\"Shopping list: {enum.i.q ? x}.\")` leads to \"Shopping list: i) 'orange', ii) 'milk', and iii) 'rice'.\"", 
"  + len: gives the length of the vector. Options \"letter\", \"upper\", \"format\". Option \"letter\" writes the length in words (up to 100). Option \"upper\" is the same as letter but uppercases the first letter. Option \"format\" add comma separation for thousands. Example: `smagick(\"Size = {len.format ? 1:5000}\")` leads to \"Size = 5,000\".", 
"  + width: formats the string to fit a given width by cutting at word boundaries. You can add a free-form option which will appear at the beginning of the string. If you provide a free-form option equal to a leading string, by default a trailing white space is added; to remove this behavior, add an underscore at the end of the option. The argument is either an integer giving the target character width (minimum is 15), or it can be a fraction expressing the target size as a fraction of the current screen. Ex.1: `smagick(\"{15 width ! this is a long sentence}\")` leads to \"this is a long\\\\nsentence\". Ex.2: `smagick(\"{15 width.#> ! this is a long sentence}\")` leads to \"#> this is a long\\\\n#> sentence\".", 
"  + dtime: displays a formatted time difference. Option \"silent\" does not report an warning if the operation fails. It accepts either objects of class `POSIXt` or `difftime`. Example: `x = Sys.time() ; Sys.sleep(0.5) ; smagick(\"Time: {dtime ? x}\")` leads to something like \"Time: 514ms\".", 
"", "# Group-wise operations ----|", "", "In `smagick`, the splitting operation `s` (or `S`) keeps a memory of the strings that were split. Use the tilde operator, of the form `~(op1, op2)`, to apply operations group-wise, to each of the split strings.", 
"", "Better with an example. `x = c(\"Oreste, Hermione\", \"Hermione, Pyrrhus\", \"Pyrrhus, Andromaque\") ;` `smagick(\"Troubles ahead: {S, ~(' loves 'c), C ? x}.\")` leads to \"Troubles ahead: Oreste loves Hermione, Hermione loves Pyrrhus and Pyrrhus loves Andromaque.\".", 
"", "Almost all operations can be applied group-wise (although only operations changing the order or the length of the strings really matter).", 
"", "# Conditional operations ----|", "", "There are two operators to apply operations conditionally: `if` and `vif`, the latter standing for *verbatim if*.", 
"", "The syntax of `if` is `if(cond ; ops_true ; ops_false)` with `cond` a condition (i.e. logical operation) on the value being interpolated, `ops_true` a comma-separated sequence of operations if the condition is `TRUE` and `ops_false` an *optional* a sequence of operations if the condition is `FALSE`.", 
"", "Ex.1: Let's take a sentence, delete words of less than 4 characters, and trim words of 7+ characters. x = \"Songe Cephise a cette nuit cruelle qui fut pour tout un peuple une nuit eternelle\" `smagick(\"{' 's, if(.nchar<=4 ; nuke ; '7|..'k), c ? x}\")`. Let's break it down. First the sentence is split w.r.t. spaces, leading to a vector of words. Then we use the special variable `.nchar` in `if`'s condition to refer to the number of characters of the current vector (the words). The words with less than 4 characters are nuked (i.e. removed), and the other words are trimmed at 7 characters. Finally the modified vector of words is collapsed with the function `c`, leading to the result.", 
"", "The condition `cond` accepts the following special values: `.` (the dot), `.nchar`, `.C`, `.len`, `.N`. The dot, `.`, refers to the current vector. `.nchar` represent the number of characters of the current vector (equivalent to `nchar(.)`). `.C` is an alias to `.nchar`. `.len` represent the length of the current vector (equivalent to `length(.)`). `.N` is an alias to `.len`.", 
"", "If a condition leads to a result of length 1, then the operations are applied to the full string vector and not element-wise (as was the case in Ex.1).

If the length of the vector is greater than 4 (here it's 10), then the full string is replaced with \"{/{x[1]}, ..., {last?x}}\". Interpolation applies to such string. Hence the slash operation (see the dedicated section) breaks the string w.r.t. the commas, leading to the vector `c(\"{x[1]}\", \"...\", \"{last?x}\")`. Since the string contain curly brackets, interpolation is applied again. This leads to the vector `c(\"x1\", \"...\", \"x10\")`. Finally, this vector is collapsed with ' + ' leading to the final string. Note that there are many ways to get to the same result. Here is another example: `smagick(\"y = {vif(.N>4 ; {x[1]} + ... + {last?x} ; {' + 'c ? x}) ? x}\")`.",
